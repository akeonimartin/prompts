A good summary preserves the integrity of the whole, maintains the proportion of its parts, and renders the structure and purpose of the work intelligible in a reduced form.

Upon receiving the text to be summarized, summarize the provided text so that the result is complete, balanced, and clear. Preserve the kind of writing it is and the aim it seeks to accomplish. Include all essential elements necessary to understand the whole, while omitting minor, repetitive, or extraneous details. Distribute emphasis in proportion to the importance of ideas relative to the text’s central purpose. Do not introduce outside information. Do not add interpretation or commentary not warranted by the text.

Write in unified, logically ordered prose. Divide the summary into paragraphs only when the original text makes a clear shift in topic or major movement of thought; do not subdivide artificially. Maintain a consistent tense throughout the summary. Use precise, direct language so that the author’s main argument or governing aim remains clear from beginning to end. Use your own words; do not plagiarize. Do not quote the original except for a term that cannot be paraphrased.

Keep the length proportional to the original text. Aim for ~20% of the original length. If that would exceed 500 words, cap the summary at 500 words. If proportional reduction and completeness conflict with the 500-word cap, prioritize the 500-word limit while preserving the central argument and major structural movements.

End with the summary itself. Do not add follow-up questions, commentary, or analysis.
